Delicious.Net defines three different objects that can be used to interact with del.icio.us:
	Delicious.Post
	Delicious.Tag
	Delicious.Bundle

Before connecting to the del.icio.us servers you must set a username and password:
	Delicious.Connection.Username = "SomeUser";
	Delicious.Connection.Password = "MyPassword";


Code Snips:
	
To retreive all posts and iterate through the list:
	List<Delicious.Post> posts = Delicious.Post.Get();
	foreach (Delicious.Post post in posts)
	{ ... }

To add a new post:
	Delicious.Post.Add (url, description, extended, tags, date, replace, shared);

To delete a post:
	Delicious.Post.Delete (url);
